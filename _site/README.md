1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle update` to update the dependencies
3. `bundle exec jekyll build` 
  
  This will build the jekyll site into `_site` directory
  which is a git submodule for the master branch. Go to the directory, commit and push    
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve` 
  
  To start locally
  
  This is actually create category and tags archives. 
  Build is not doing it.
