I am alone...

When I was just looking at all the other kids who were playing cricket, I am alone...

When they form a gang and fight together, I am alone...

When the whole class laughed at me on my mistakes when my teacher asked me to read a paragraph in the textbook, I am alone...

When I bunked my school without letting my mother know, I am alone...

When I stole money to go to a picnic organized by the school, I am alone...

When I was beaten in front of the whole class by the principal who suspected me as thief though I was innocent, I am alone...

When I created a fake report card and could not let the truth out, I am alone...

When my aunt told her daughter not to talk/play with me because I am a bad boy, I am alone...

When I do all these things without liking them, I am alone...

When there is no one who can understand what I am going through, I am alone...

Finally, When I fail, I am alone...
                          
<br/>
<br/>                
<br/>
<br/>

But there is one change, one day, one moment, one small hope.......

All I need was a small bit of self-confidence which has turned everything.

Now, I am not alone...
